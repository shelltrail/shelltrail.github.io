      <description>&lt;p&gt;An internal security assessment, which is commonly performed together with an
assessment of the Active Directory environment, is a common way to evaluate an
organizations defense-in-depth against an attacker. A common misconception is
that the protection provided by perimeter defenses are sufficient to effectively
stop and outside attacker, however this is rarely the case as credential
leakage/guessing, phishing, the use of zero-day vulnerabilities and social
engineering are all attacks that could aid an attacker in breaching the
perimeter defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-an-internal-pentest&#34;&gt;What is an internal pentest?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A penetration test of the internal systems are commonly performed as what is
called an &amp;ldquo;Assume Breach&amp;rdquo;-scenario, where the test simulates that a resource
such as a workstation on the internal network has been compromised by an
attacker. A test is typically conducted during 2 weeks (for an average-sized
environment), even if the time allocation can vary depending on the scope of the
test and which initial access methodology is chosen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the most common scenario, &amp;ldquo;Assume Breach&amp;rdquo;, Shelltrails security experts will
assess the internal environment such as web applications, internal servers and
services as well as the Active Directory in order to elevate privileges and move
laterally to additional targets. The goal of the assessment is to detect
vulnerabilities that after mitigation, will improve the company&amp;rsquo;s resilience during
an attack. Additional targets may also be chosen such as finding and compromising
backup-servers, hypervisors or gaining access to highly privileged accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pentest contains several parts and systems, including (but not limited to):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal web applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access Control Lists in the AD environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuration servers such as SCCM/MECM/ConfigMgr&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certificate Services (AD CS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQL servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-and-when-should-we-pentest-our-internal-services&#34;&gt;Why and when should we pentest our internal services?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of a pentest is to increase the resilience of the internal network
against a threat with limited access, by uncovering the paths the attacker may
take to move laterally or elevate privileges. By identifying weak points, and
reducing or removing their exploitability, the security posture of the entire
network is strengthened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend all organizations with medium to large internal environments to
conduct internal security assessments on a yearly basis, as new tools,
techniques and attacks are constantly introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-result-of-an-internal-pentest&#34;&gt;The result of an internal pentest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An internal pentest concludes with a de-briefing meeting and a report
summarizing the identified vulnerabilities, how they are exploited as well as
how they can be fixed or mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;
