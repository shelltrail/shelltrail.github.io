      <title>Cloud security assessment</title>
      <link>https://www.shelltrail.com/cyber-security-services/cloud-security-assessment/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;More and more companies are choosing to place their services with public cloud
providers. There can be many reasons, but the most common is that it is easy to
get started with, it simplifies scalability and operational reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cloud provider is responsible for the overall IT security according to their
&lt;strong&gt;Shared Responsibility Model&lt;/strong&gt;, and it is up to
the administrator to what areas are under their care. It is in the
latter case that it can be valuable to perform a cloud security audit by having a
security provider like Shelltrail to assist with the expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-is-a-cloud-security-audit-conducted&#34;&gt;How is a cloud security audit conducted?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common starting point for a cloud security audit is to examine the resources
in the cloud environment through a Read-only or Security Audit account and analyze the
security posture of the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the areas reviewed in a cloud security audit include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Permission assignments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management of privileged accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exposed resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Segmentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data encryption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelltrail&amp;rsquo;s security testers have several years of experience in reviewing the
major cloud providers on the market, and with certifications issued by both Amazon
AWS and Microsoft Azure, Shelltrail also has proven knowledge within the domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, an analysis of the cloud environment is included during a web application test
when it is deployed in a public cloud environment. The reason for the combination of web
and cloud auditing is that it provides more in-depth protection. Typically, the test
takes a couple of days to perform, but this depends on the size of the cloud infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelltrail&amp;rsquo;s habit of working with different cloud providers means that we have the
experience to perform tests and follow each cloud provider&amp;rsquo;s Rules of Engagement
for security audits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-should-the-cloud-environment-be-audited&#34;&gt;Why should the cloud environment be audited?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called &lt;strong&gt;Shared Responsibility Model&lt;/strong&gt; among the different cloud providers,
for instance at &lt;a href=&#34;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility&#34;&gt;Microsoft Azure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-risk-and-compliance/shared-responsibility-model.html&#34;&gt;Amazon AWS&lt;/a&gt; explains that the responsibility for certain
security aspects lies with the administrator, depending on the type of deployment
(SaaS, PaaS, IaaS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional reasons might include: requirements from customers or suppliers, customer trust and
reputation, regulatory requirements (GDPR, PCI DSS, ISO 27001) or verification of the current security posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;upon-completion-of-the-assignment&#34;&gt;Upon completion of the assignment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the completion of the assignment, a debriefing takes place where Shelltrail&amp;rsquo;s
security experts go through the entire report, which includes a full presentation of
all security issues. The report begins with a high-level summary where the emphasis on
risks is prioritized over technical analyses. Normally, within a few days after the
completion of the assignment, the report is delivered in its final format.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>External infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://www.shelltrail.com/cyber-security-services/external-infrastructure/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When was the last time your company performed an inventory and review of all
internet-exposed systems? This is a good question to seek an answer to when you
want to assess the risk of your internet presence. Systems become obsolete, and
new vulnerabilities are discovered daily, which means companies must be diligent
in inventorying their systems, which ports are exposed, which versions of
different software are running, and map these against vulnerabilities that pose
a real threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a challenging task that must be iterated at regular basis and is not
always in line with the company&amp;rsquo;s prioritized goals. A common reason is a
&lt;em&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t fix it if it ain&amp;rsquo;t broken&lt;/em&gt; a attitude in combination with prioritization
of scale an growth which may leave internet-exposed system vulnerable to attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-does-a-pentest-of-external-infrastructure-entail&#34;&gt;What does a pentest of external infrastructure entail?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assignment usually begins with the client providing a list of IP addresses and
domain names to be reviewed. In addition to this, Shelltrail uses Open Source
Intelligence sources (OSINT) to try to find more systems that may be undocumented
or classified as &lt;em&gt;Shadow IT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the list of identified systems is deemed complete, it is verified that all
targets are under the client&amp;rsquo;s security responsibility and not third-party
systems. If third-party systems are involved, written approval regarding the
security audit of the third-party must be submitted to Shelltrail&amp;rsquo;s security
consultants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a complete list of legitimate targets, the testing begins where a
combination of automated and manual security audits of the systems is performed. Here,
techniques from all of Shelltrail&amp;rsquo;s areas of expertise are combined, such as
security reviews of web applications, Windows and Linux attacks, binary
exploitation, and cloud-specific attacks, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelltrail&amp;rsquo;s security experts possess a broad background in cybersecurity audits,
which serves well for the varied services that can be exposed on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-and-when-should-an-external-infrastructure-review-be-performed&#34;&gt;Why and when should an external infrastructure review be performed?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As previously mentioned, new vulnerabilities are discovered daily and systems
become End-of-Life, sometimes leading to the manufacturer ceasing to maintain
systems with security updates. This makes it important to periodically conduct a
review of internet-exposed systems to secure them before attackers find the system.
Regardless of whether your company produces garden hoses or develops pharmaceuticals,
your internet-exposed systems may become a target for opportunistic attackers
scanning the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-result&#34;&gt;The Result&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assignment results in a professional report where all security issues are described
in a detail. The vulnerabilities described in the report are ranked from
critical to low, and in combination with the client&amp;rsquo;s perceived risks, the report
can be used as a priority list in which order to address the problems. It is not
uncommon for the report to be used to increase the security budget for a company
or to inform, for example, management that security must be prioritized.&lt;/p&gt;
