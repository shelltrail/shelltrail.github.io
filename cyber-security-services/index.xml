      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes is a commonly used container orchestration tool providing scalability
and resilience to enterprises utilizing containerized applications. Whether
it may be internal policies or for compliance reasons, it is always beneficial
to perform security assessments to proactively find vulnerabilities or
misconfigurations. This may lower probability of a compromise occurring, and
minimize the impact if it happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-assessed-in-a-kubernetes-security-review&#34;&gt;What is assessed in a Kubernetes security review?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When doing a Kubernetes security review the initial perspective can vary, it
may be from the perspective of a compromised pod, a specific namespace or an employee with developer access.
From here publicly known attack paths will be evaluated in an attempt
to reach sensitive information or cluster-wide compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, CIS benchmarks will be used as a foundation for the assessment
making sure that industry standard best-practices is evaluated in the environment.
The Center for Internet Security (CIS) is a nonprofit organization that enhances
cybersecurity readiness and response across public and private sectors.
CIS provides extensive checklists in terms of best practices for security
configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deliverables-after-conducting-a-security-review&#34;&gt;Deliverables after conducting a security review&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the assessment a de-briefing meeting with key stakeholders will
be held to present the findings from the assessment, discuss recommendations and address
questions or concerns.
After the de-brief meeting the report will be delivered which includes an
assessment description, a results &amp;amp; recommendations section and an executive
summary. The executive summary is commonly used as a customer facing
report showing proactive work in the IT security realm.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cloud security assessment</title>
      <link>https://www.shelltrail.com/cyber-security-services/cloud-security-assessment/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.shelltrail.com/cyber-security-services/cloud-security-assessment/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;More and more companies are choosing to place their services with public cloud
providers. There can be many reasons, but the most common is that it is easy to
get started with, it simplifies scalability and operational reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cloud provider is responsible for the overall IT security according to their
&lt;strong&gt;Shared Responsibility Model&lt;/strong&gt;, and it is up to
the administrator to what areas are under their care. It is in the
latter case that it can be valuable to perform a cloud security audit by having a
security provider like Shelltrail to assist with the expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-is-a-cloud-security-audit-conducted&#34;&gt;How is a cloud security audit conducted?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common starting point for a cloud security audit is to examine the resources
in the cloud environment through a Read-only or Security Audit account and analyze the
security posture of the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the areas reviewed in a cloud security audit include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Permission assignments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management of privileged accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exposed resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Segmentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data encryption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelltrail&amp;rsquo;s security testers have several years of experience in reviewing the
major cloud providers on the market, and with certifications issued by both Amazon
AWS and Microsoft Azure, Shelltrail also has proven knowledge within the domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, an analysis of the cloud environment is included during a web application test
when it is deployed in a public cloud environment. The reason for the combination of web
and cloud auditing is that it provides more in-depth protection. Typically, the test
takes a couple of days to perform, but this depends on the size of the cloud infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelltrail&amp;rsquo;s habit of working with different cloud providers means that we have the
experience to perform tests and follow each cloud provider&amp;rsquo;s Rules of Engagement
for security audits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-should-the-cloud-environment-be-audited&#34;&gt;Why should the cloud environment be audited?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called &lt;strong&gt;Shared Responsibility Model&lt;/strong&gt; among the different cloud providers,
for instance at &lt;a href=&#34;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility&#34;&gt;Microsoft Azure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-risk-and-compliance/shared-responsibility-model.html&#34;&gt;Amazon AWS&lt;/a&gt; explains that the responsibility for certain
security aspects lies with the administrator, depending on the type of deployment
(SaaS, PaaS, IaaS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional reasons might include: requirements from customers or suppliers, customer trust and
reputation, regulatory requirements (GDPR, PCI DSS, ISO 27001) or verification of the current security posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;upon-completion-of-the-assignment&#34;&gt;Upon completion of the assignment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the completion of the assignment, a debriefing takes place where Shelltrail&amp;rsquo;s
security experts go through the entire report, which includes a full presentation of
all security issues. The report begins with a high-level summary where the emphasis on
risks is prioritized over technical analyses. Normally, within a few days after the
completion of the assignment, the report is delivered in its final format.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>External infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://www.shelltrail.com/cyber-security-services/external-infrastructure/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.shelltrail.com/cyber-security-services/external-infrastructure/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When was the last time your company performed an inventory and review of all
internet-exposed systems? This is a good question to seek an answer to when you
want to assess the risk of your internet presence. Systems become obsolete, and
new vulnerabilities are discovered daily, which means companies must be diligent
in inventorying their systems, which ports are exposed, which versions of
different software are running, and map these against vulnerabilities that pose
a real threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a challenging task that must be iterated at regular basis and is not
always in line with the company&amp;rsquo;s prioritized goals. A common reason is a
&lt;em&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t fix it if it ain&amp;rsquo;t broken&lt;/em&gt; a attitude in combination with prioritization
of scale an growth which may leave internet-exposed system vulnerable to attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-does-a-pentest-of-external-infrastructure-entail&#34;&gt;What does a pentest of external infrastructure entail?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assignment usually begins with the client providing a list of IP addresses and
domain names to be reviewed. In addition to this, Shelltrail uses Open Source
Intelligence sources (OSINT) to try to find more systems that may be undocumented
or classified as &lt;em&gt;Shadow IT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the list of identified systems is deemed complete, it is verified that all
targets are under the client&amp;rsquo;s security responsibility and not third-party
systems. If third-party systems are involved, written approval regarding the
security audit of the third-party must be submitted to Shelltrail&amp;rsquo;s security
consultants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a complete list of legitimate targets, the testing begins where a
combination of automated and manual security audits of the systems is performed. Here,
techniques from all of Shelltrail&amp;rsquo;s areas of expertise are combined, such as
security reviews of web applications, Windows and Linux attacks, binary
exploitation, and cloud-specific attacks, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelltrail&amp;rsquo;s security experts possess a broad background in cybersecurity audits,
which serves well for the varied services that can be exposed on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-and-when-should-an-external-infrastructure-review-be-performed&#34;&gt;Why and when should an external infrastructure review be performed?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As previously mentioned, new vulnerabilities are discovered daily and systems
become End-of-Life, sometimes leading to the manufacturer ceasing to maintain
systems with security updates. This makes it important to periodically conduct a
review of internet-exposed systems to secure them before attackers find the system.
Regardless of whether your company produces garden hoses or develops pharmaceuticals,
your internet-exposed systems may become a target for opportunistic attackers
scanning the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-result&#34;&gt;The Result&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assignment results in a professional report where all security issues are described
in a detail. The vulnerabilities described in the report are ranked from
critical to low, and in combination with the client&amp;rsquo;s perceived risks, the report
can be used as a priority list in which order to address the problems. It is not
uncommon for the report to be used to increase the security budget for a company
or to inform, for example, management that security must be prioritized.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Internal/Active Directory penetration test</title>
      <link>https://www.shelltrail.com/cyber-security-services/internal-and-active-directory-penetration-test/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.shelltrail.com/cyber-security-services/internal-and-active-directory-penetration-test/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An internal security assessment, which is commonly performed together with an
assessment of the Active Directory environment, is a common way to evaluate an
organizations defense-in-depth against an attacker. A common misconception is
that the protection provided by perimeter defenses are sufficient to effectively
stop and outside attacker, however this is rarely the case as credential
leakage/guessing, phishing, the use of zero-day vulnerabilities and social
engineering are all attacks that could aid an attacker in breaching the
perimeter defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-an-internal-pentest&#34;&gt;What is an internal pentest?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A penetration test of the internal systems are commonly performed as what is
called an &amp;ldquo;Assume Breach&amp;rdquo;-scenario, where the test simulates that a resource
such as a workstation on the internal network has been compromised by an
attacker. A test is typically conducted during 2 weeks (for an average-sized
environment), even if the time allocation can vary depending on the scope of the
test and which initial access methodology is chosen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the most common scenario, &amp;ldquo;Assume Breach&amp;rdquo;, Shelltrails security experts will
assess the internal environment such as web applications, internal servers and
services as well as the Active Directory in order to elevate privileges and move
laterally to additional targets. The goal of the assessment is to detect
vulnerabilities that after mitigation, will improve the company&amp;rsquo;s resilience during
an attack. Additional targets may also be chosen such as finding and compromising
backup-servers, hypervisors or gaining access to highly privileged accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pentest contains several parts and systems, including (but not limited to):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal web applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access Control Lists in the AD environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuration servers such as SCCM/MECM/ConfigMgr&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certificate Services (AD CS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQL servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-and-when-should-we-pentest-our-internal-services&#34;&gt;Why and when should we pentest our internal services?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of a pentest is to increase the resilience of the internal network
against a threat with limited access, by uncovering the paths the attacker may
take to move laterally or elevate privileges. By identifying weak points, and
reducing or removing their exploitability, the security posture of the entire
network is strengthened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend all organizations with medium to large internal environments to
conduct internal security assessments on a yearly basis, as new tools,
techniques and attacks are constantly introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-result-of-an-internal-pentest&#34;&gt;The result of an internal pentest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An internal pentest concludes with a de-briefing meeting and a report
summarizing the identified vulnerabilities, how they are exploited as well as
how they can be fixed or mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Red Team engagement</title>
      <link>https://www.shelltrail.com/cyber-security-services/red-team-engagement/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.shelltrail.com/cyber-security-services/red-team-engagement/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Red Team-engagement is a simulated attack on an organization from a holistic
view that can include several different parts, such as phishing, social
engineering, attacks against externally exposed infrastructure as well as
internal systems. The simulation is intended to be similar to a real-world
attack, using the same Tools, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) used by real
attackers (and often based on the specific threat actors of the targeted
business sector).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-red-team-engagement&#34;&gt;What is a Red Team engagement?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Team engagement are often confused with the closely related term penetration
testing, but differs greatly in a number of areas. While both deal with the
identification and exploitation of vulnerabilities they have different
methodology, goals, purpose and execution. While a pentest aims at identifying
as many vulnerabilities as possible in a network or system, a Red Team
engagement aim to assess an entire organizations resilience against a targeted
attack with one or more specific goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of a Red Team engagement can be, for instance to access specific
sensitive information, a certain mail account or the CEO&amp;rsquo;s user account in the
Active Directory domain. This often means that the attacker can act more
like a real threat, acting more stealthy as the goal is not to exploit
vulnerabilities that may trigger certain alarms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a Red Team engagement it is also common to only notify a select group of
people that are aware the test is being conducted, so that the actions and
reactions from the staff more closely resembles what would happen in a
real-world scenario. By doing this, the organizational procedures can be
evaluated and improved upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-and-when-should-a-red-team-engagement-be-conducted&#34;&gt;Why and when should a Red Team engagement be conducted?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is recommended to perform a Red Team engagement when the security posture of
the internal network is mature and tools and procedures are in place to handle
threats within the organization. As the aim is to evaluate how an entire
organization handles an attack, there is little need for evaluation if the
procedures are not in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the network has undergone an internal assessment, identified
vulnerabilities fixed, procedures and monitoring are in place it would be a good
time to conduct a Red Team engagement to verify that everything works as
intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides these occasions, some regulatory frameworks such as Threat
Intelligence-based Ethical Red Teaming (TIBER) may require you to perform Red
Team exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reporting-and-results&#34;&gt;Reporting and results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reporting of a Red Team engagement differs from that of a normal pentest, as
the goals and approach to the test are different between the two test types. In
this type of test, the reporting is focused around what&amp;rsquo;s called an attack
narrative where the testers describes attacks performed, why the types of attack
were used, what the expected reactions from the defending team was and what
actually happened. As the goal is aimed at a specific target, all identified
vulnerabilities may not be included, but rather the path chosen by the attackers
at reaching the specified target. The report and de-briefing meeting also aims
to identify improvements that have an overall impact on both a technical as well
as on an organizational level.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Web assessment</title>
      <link>https://www.shelltrail.com/cyber-security-services/web-security-assessment/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.shelltrail.com/cyber-security-services/web-security-assessment/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Web applications in all its forms are often categorized as critical systems for
organizations, whether being the organizations own internet exposed services,
SaaS-solutions, products or internal systems. Web applications are often
complex solutions with lots of functionality and thus constitute a large (often
internet-exposed) attack surface. With these characteristics it is paramount to
conduct security assessments to ensure the security of the application on a
regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-web-application-security-assessmentpentest&#34;&gt;What is a web application security assessment/pentest?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A web application pentest is an assessment of the security of a web application
conducted by seasoned security experts where the testers try to uncover security
issues by hacking the web application in the same manner and with the same tools
as real-world attackers would. The uncovered vulnerabilities can later be fixed
or mitigated using the recommendations given by the pentesters, thereby
strengthening the security of the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security assessment is conducted to uncover vulnerabilities that are covered
in standards such as OWASP Top 10 and OWASP Testing Guide, but is not only
limited to these, as it is not uncommon to find logical issues and other issues
which are related to the organizations sector as well. The tests are tailored to
match the risks identified by the target organization, and identifying
vulnerabilities that could lead to those risks, in order to minimize them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-and-when-should-you-conduct-a-security-assessment&#34;&gt;Why and when should you conduct a security assessment?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of reasons why a web application security assessment should
be conducted, some of which are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applications are business critical and should be better protected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon procuring or integrating third-party components it is common to perform
due-diligence or to assess the integration effort to ensure no new
vulnerabilities have been introduced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers regularly want to be ensured that security assessments have been
performed on products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rules and regulatory frameworks (such as PCI-DSS) require or recommend that
a pentest of the application has been performed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common web application pentest is conducted during a period of 1-2 weeks and
result in a report and a de-briefing meeting, where all details about the
identified vulnerabilities are discussed and how these can be remedied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelltrail&amp;rsquo;s security experts have experience from hundreds of security
assessments of web applications and have some of the highest certifications in
the industry when it comes to offensive security in web applications.&lt;/p&gt;
